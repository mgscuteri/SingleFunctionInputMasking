# SingleFunctionInputMasking
Single function input masking. 100% stateless. 100% vanilla js.  Designed to be copied and pasted into any project. 

HTML input masking, done with a single function.  1 function to do string manipulation called every time the input value changes. (And 1 more optional function to bind the string manipulation to the input objects which I'm not counting because I like the name "SingleFunctionInputMasking")  100% stateless. 100% vanilla js.  Designed to be copied and pasted into any project, using any framework.
